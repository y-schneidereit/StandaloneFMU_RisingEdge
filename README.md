I have problems to execute my fmu who is generated by Simulink. <br>
Can not use the *fmi2functions*. At debugging there is a **read access violation**. <br>
I guess that is because of the *fmuResourceLocation* argument of the *fmi2Instantiate()*. The generated fmu by Simulink do not have a resources folder. <br>
Already tryed with an empty string, a nullptr and also an absolute path to the unzipped fmu. <br>
